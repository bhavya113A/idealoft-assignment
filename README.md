This project is a static website designed for EquiTek. The website features a modern, responsive design with sections for home, about us, products, VR experiences, and a mailing list signup.



I have to write some point that i experienced:

-> I had a great experience working on the design aspect of the project. It allowed me to apply my existing knowledge and learn new design principles, significantly enhancing my skills.

-> Implementing the explore button using JavaScript was a valuable learning opportunity. It enabled me to understand how to create interactive elements that enhance user engagement.

-> Developing the footer page was particularly rewarding. It provided me with a chance to apply everything Iâ€™ve learned about web development, ensuring a cohesive and functional design.
